# Parth Mandewalkar's First CS193 Homework

Here are some of my favorite things about CS193:
- My TAs are awesome. They are super kind, and willing to help out.
- The class is very low commitment (at least compared to CS180), which makes things a lot less stressful.
- There are multiple PSO meetings that I can attend for CS related help.
- I have a bunch of friends in my 193 class who not only make things more interesting, but can also help me out with some stuff.
